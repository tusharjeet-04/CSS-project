    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1" class="lineh">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media.</li>
        <li><b><span class="text">CSS is not necessary </span> <span class="bgcolor">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b>
            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li class="italic">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul type="disc" class="space">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in th head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><span
                class="bgcolor">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b>because this is easier
            to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on
        the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
        link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.

        In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web pages.Once an elements has
        been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        <br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.
